# Terraform

- Terraform is an Orchestration Tool, that is part of IaaS.

- Chef and Packer are more on the side of Config Management and create immutable AMI's.

- Terraform Orchestrates the creation of networks and complex systems and deploys AMI's.

- An AMI is a blueprint (snapshot) of an instance:
  - The operating system
  - Data and storage
  - All the packages and exact state of a machine when AMI was created
